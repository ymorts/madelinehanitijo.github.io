I contributed to my friend Corwin's book - Music of an Immortal: Requiem with a front / back cover! Thank you Corwin for trusting me with this project.

I first read Music of an Immortal and created a few thumbnails based on scenes / themes from the book. In every cover, I wanted to incorporate the main character, Lin Jia, with her weapon of choice, her Dizi, along with Shia the snake. 


Client and I settled on the compisition featuring Lin Jia before and after the events of the book. As she becomes a member of the inner sect, Lin Jia is no longer an innocent child for whom her dizi is a mere hobby.  It is now a weapon, its requiems serving as a valuable tool against the demons of her world.

The back cover utilizes the same scenery from the front cover, but puts a greater focus on Shia. Shia is a character who helps Lin Jia on her journey, but I can't help but think that she has ulterior motives. Here, she is hiding among the trees, taking on a form quite different from the one described in the book... ;)

Please read Music of an Immortal: Requiem when it comes out! I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Wuxia and Chinese-inspired fantasy.
