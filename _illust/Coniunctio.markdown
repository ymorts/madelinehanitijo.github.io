Coniunctio is a Houseki no Kuni fanzine. I was chosen as a page illustrator, and later put the zine together as the mods had abandoned the project. 

<h3>Illustration</h3>

I decided to draw Dia for my piece, as I was a big fan of their character journey throughout the series. Their development from someone quiet and timid, to someone proud and somewhat unhinged was very entertaining. I really wanted to depict Dia's insecurity in the face of their brother Bort in conjunction with the idol persona she builds on the moon, as I felt that those aspects directly influence each other. 

<div class="img_row">
	<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/dia_sketch_2.jpg">
		<img class="col two" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/dia_sketch_2.jpg" alt="" title="composition 1"/>
	</a>

	<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/dia_sketch.jpg">
		<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/dia_sketch.jpg" alt="" title="composition 2"/>
	</a>
</div>

<h3>Formatting</h3>
<img class="col half" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/v1_fics.jpg" alt="" title="light mode"/>
<img class="col half" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/v2_fics.jpg" alt="" title="dark mode"/>
I took the initiative in compiling the work of all contributors into a digital PDF.
I played around with fanfic layouts. I also illustrated the title frame.

<img class="col half" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/gemblems_rough.jpg" alt="" title="initial sketch"/>

<img class="col half" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/gemblems_complete.jpg" alt="" title="illustrated format"/>

I illustrated unique gem emblems for the table of contents page. Each contributor is listed with gems that signified the contents of the artists' work! For example, I drew Dia, so my emblem is a Diamond with a bow.
