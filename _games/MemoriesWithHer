Memories with Her is a visual novel about a queer woman, Mei, reconciling with the death of her long-term girlfriend through revisiting locations significant to their relationship. This visual novel was created in a small team with the prompt of using contemporary artwork as inspiration. We chose Queering the Map and Untitled (Portrait of Ross in LA).

Memories with Her was my first time working on a game in a team, as well as the first visual novel I've produced with a full soundtrack and non-story, interactive elements! I learned a lot from this experience and I'm so proud of my team and I for creating this!

I played around with interactivity, creating 2 point and click minigames.
