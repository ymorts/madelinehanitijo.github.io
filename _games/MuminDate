A Date with Mu Min is a visual novel about a young heiress who has a crush on her cyborg bodyguard. Illustration, story, writing, and programming were all done by me. 
<br>
<br>

<h3>Illustration</h3>

I've always been a huge sucker for the bodyguard / princess dynamic and I wanted to create a game based around it. It's been a few years since its creation and I'm not entirely satisfied with the story anymore. However, I do love both Xiao Yang and Mu Min, so I plan on revisiting and remaking their dynamic.

<h3>Backgrounds</h3>
<div class="img_row">
<img class="col half" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/mm-bg1.jpg" alt="" title="Cafe background"/>
<img class="col half" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/mm-bg2.jpg" alt="" title="Alleys background"/>
</div>
<div class="img_row">
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/mm-bg3.jpg" alt="" title="Streets background"/>
</div>
I illustrated the backgrounds for the project as well. The interior of the cafe is based on the PeggyPorschen bakery, designed by Kinnersley Kent.

<h3>UI</h3>
<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col half" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/dating-ui.jpg" alt="" title="Dating UI explorations."/>
    <img class="col half" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/sheep-start.jpg" alt="" title="Start Screen of A Date with Mu Min."/>
</div>
I did some explorations regarding UI, especially during the "dating" portions in the cafe. 

The main screen font is Scholarly Ambition by nhfonts.

This project really solidified my love for games and sapphic stories. Xiao Yang and Mu Min I will always love you.
